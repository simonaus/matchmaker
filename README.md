## Introduction
Matchmaker is social-network focused matchmaking app optimised for Android OS. 

The core mission of Matchmaker is to facilitate romantic pairings and aims to represent a counter-culture to the gamification and anonymity of modern-dating apps. Despite having the same mission as many dating apps (finding connections), Matchmaker does seek to separate itself from the dating app space as the core focus is not on finding connections for oneself, rather finding connections for others. A world in which people are mutually connect those around them will result in lower frequency but higher quality romances.  

Matchmaker was built using React Native on the front-end and expressJS and PostgreSQL on the back-end and uses the Facebook API to facilite the quick integration of the user's pre-existing social network into Matchmaker. This is key to the successful implementation of the app.
